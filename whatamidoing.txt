i dont know

problem:

snake coordinates and snaketail coordinates not matching up

Solution:

add a range

problem: because of range, snaketail follow code runs more than once

solution:

add "followed" boolean variable

problem:

snake tail can only turn when followed is False, therefore it cannot turn immediately after it has followed, 
and the snake has not yet turned

---> this applies when turning multiple times in a row :(

---> under what conditions should snake be able to turn?

solution:

ADD another Variable! "turnedtwice"

if followed = True and x < ???? (secondary condition when snake is one or more turns ahead of snaketail) or
make variable counting number of times snaketail has turned in addition to snake head?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

problem: still glitches out, assumed because snaketail eventually goes off center

solution: reset snaketail's coords(?) --> be on exact coords of snake (previously) OR make new snaketail object..
